Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers with $k\le2^n$.
Mingus has deck of $2^n$ cards, and he knows exactly $k$
of them are black.
At the cost of a coin, Mingus can select a subset $S$ of the cards,
and an oracle will tell him whether the number of black cards in $S$ 
is even or odd.
Prove that Mingus can determine exactly which cards are black
with at the cost of at most $kn$ coin.

Suppose we are given a labeling $\vphi:\{\text{cards}\}\to\FF_{2^n}$
of the cards by elements of $\FF_{2^n}$,
and that the black cards are $x_1$, $\ldots$, $x_k$.
\setcounter{claim}0
\begin{claim}
    In $n$ queries, Mingus may determine $x_1+\cdots+x_k$.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
    Fix a basis $\{1,\alpha,\ldots,\alpha^{n-1}\}$ of $\FF_{2^n}$ over $\FF_2$.
    For each $j=0,\ldots,n-1$, Mingus queries the set $S_j$ of cards
    whose $\alpha^j$-coefficient is 1. 
    Then, the $\alpha^j$-coefficient of $x_1+\cdots+x_k$ is 1 if and only if
    the oracle returns odd for $S_j$.
    Thus, after querying $S_0$, $\ldots$, $S_{n-1}$.
    Mingus knows $x_1+\cdots+x_k$.
\end{proof}
\begin{claim}
    For each $j$, Mingus may determine $x_1^j+\cdots+x_k^j$
    in $n$ queries.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
    Mingus may apply the procedure for Claim 1
    to the labeling \[\vphi_j:\{\text{cards}\}\to\FF_{2^n}$
    by $\vphi_j(x)=\vphi(x)^j.\qedhere\]
\end{proof}
