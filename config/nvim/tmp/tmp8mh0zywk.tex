Define $F_1=F_2=1$ and $F_k=F_{k-1}+F_{k-2}$ for $n\ge3$.
Say a positive integer $n$ \emph{appears in nature} if $n=F_k$ for some positive integer $k$.

Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers such that
\[
    \vphi(ab+1)\quad\text{divides}\quad a^2+b^2+1,
\]
where $\vphi(n)$ denotes the number of positive integers at most $n$ relatively prime to $n$.
Prove that $a$ and $b$ appear in nature.
