An integer $N\ge2$ is given. A collection of $N(N+1)$ soccer players, no two of whom are of the same height, stand in a row. Sir Alex wants to remove $N(N-1)$ players from this row leaving a new row of $2N$ players in which the following $N$ conditions hold: no one stands between the two tallest players, no one stands between the third and fourth tallest players, $\ldots$, no one stands between the two shortest players. Show that this is always possible.

Let $S_k$ denote the set of soccer players with height $h$ obeying $(k-1)(N+1)<h\le k(N+1)$, so that $S_1$, $S_2$, $\ldots$, $S_N$ is a partition of the soccer players into $N$ groups of size $N+1$. We will prove inductively it is possible to select two people from each set $S_k$.

Scan the line from left to right until we find two people in the same set $S_k$. Then
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
\item select those two people;
\item delete everyone scanned; and
\item delete everyone in the set $S_k$.
\end{itemize}
Besides $S_k$, in all groups $N$ people remain, and the pair we have selected is the leftmost one, so we may induct down.
\begin{remark}
    The problem is invariant when swapping location and height, so essentially all solutions are isomorphic to each other. The solution works if we instead group the players by location and select two players from the group whose second-shortest player is as short as possible.
\end{remark}
