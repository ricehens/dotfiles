Find all positive integers $n$ for which $2^n-1$ has a multiple of the form $m^2+9$.

The answer is all powers of $2$. First assume $2^n-1$ has a prime divisor $p>3$ with $p\equiv3\pmod4$. Then $m^2\equiv-9\pmod p$, which is absurd. Furthermore for all odd $k\ge3$, $2^k-1$ is $3\pmod4$ but not divisible by $3$. Hence if $n$ has an odd prime factor $p$, $2^p-1\mid2^n-1$ and $2^p-1$ has a prime divisor greater than $3$ and equivalent to $3\pmod4$, so $n$ fails.

It suffices to show $n=2^k$ works for $k\ge0$. Suppose a prime $p\equiv3\pmod4$ divides $2^n-1$. Then $2^{2^k}\equiv1\pmod p$ and $2^{p-1}\equiv1\pmod p$. Since $\gcd(2^k,p-1)=2$, we have $p\mid2^2-1=3$, so $p=3$. Clearly $k=0$ works, so assume $k\ge1$: by lifting the exponent, $\nu_3(2^{2^k}-1)=\nu_3(4^{2^{k-1}}-1)=1$, so $-1$ is a quadratic residue mod $(2^n-1)/3$; let $t$ be a square root. Then $m=3t$ works, so we are done.
