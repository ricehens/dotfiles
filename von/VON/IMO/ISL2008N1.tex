Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $p$ be a prime number. Prove that if $a$, $b$, $c$ are integers (not necessarily positive) satisfying the equations \[a^n+pb=b^n+pc=c^n+pa\]
then $a=b=c$.

Assume that there is a unique maximum $c$; WLOG $a\le b$. Then $c^n-b^n=p(c-a)$ and $c^n-a^n=p(b-a)$. However by hypothesis, $c-a>b-a$ and $c^n-b^n\le c^n-a^n$, contradiction.

Analogously there is no unique minimum, so $a=b=c$.
