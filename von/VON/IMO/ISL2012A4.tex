Let $f$ and $g$ be two nonzero polynomials with integer coefficients and $\deg f>\deg g$. Suppose that for infinitely many primes $p$ the polynomial $pf+g$ has a rational root. Prove that $f$ has a rational root.

I claim the roots of $pf+g$ lie on $[-R,R]$ for some constant $R$. Since $\deg f>\deg g$, there is an $R$ such that for all $|x|>R$, we have $|g(x)/f(x)|<1$. Hence for such $x$ and all primes $p$, \[|pf(x)+g(x)|\ge|f(x)|\left(p-\left\lvert\frac{g(x)}{f(x)}\right\rvert\right)>0\]
so the roots of $pf+g$ lie in $[-R,R]$.

By Gauss' lemma $pf+g$ is the product of two polynomials $h_p$ and $j_p$, with the leading coefficient of $h_p$ dividing that of $f$, and $1\in\{\deg h_p,\deg j_p\}$. There are finitely many possible leading coefficients and degrees, so assume infinitely many $h_p$ have the same degree and leading coefficient.

There are finitely many possible set of roots of $h_p$ by Rational Root theorem, so there are finitely many possible $h_p$. Thus for some $h$, we have $h=h_p$ infinitely often. But if $h=h_p=h_q$, then $h$ divides $pf-g$ and $qf-g$, so $h$ divides $(p-q)f$. Since $\deg h=1$ or $\deg h=\deg f-1$, $f$ has a rational root, as desired.
