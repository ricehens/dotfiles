In some country several pairs of cities are connected by direct two-way flights. It is possible to go from any city to any other by a sequence of flights. The distance between two cities is defined to be the least possible number of flights required to go from one of them to the other. It is known that for any city there are at most 100 cities at distance exactly three from it. Prove that there is no city such that more than 2550 other cities have distance exactly four from it.

Pick an arbitrary city $V$, and let $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$, $S_4$ be the set of cities a distance of exactly $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ from $V$. Call the children of a city $U$ the set of cities whose distance from $V$ is one more than the distance from $U$ to $V$, and whose shortest path to $V$ passes through $U$.

Let $m=|S_2|$ and $k=|S_1|$, and let $x_i$, $i\le k$, denote the number of children of each element of $S_1$, so that $m=x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_k$. By hypothesis on arbitrary nodes in $S_1$, each node has at most $100-m+x_i$ great-grandchildren, for $i\le k$. Hence \[|S_4|\le\sum_{i=1}^k(100-m+x_k)=k(100-m)+m\le m(101-m)\le2550,\]
as desired.
