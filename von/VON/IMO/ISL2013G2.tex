Let $\omega$ be the circumcircle of a triangle $ABC$. Denote by $M$ and $N$ the midpoints of the sides $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, and denote by $T$ the midpoint of the arc $BC$ of $\omega$ not containing $A$. The circumcircles of the triangles $AMT$ and $ANT$ intersect the perpendicular bisectors of $\seg{AC}$ and $\seg{AB}$ at points $X$ and $Y$, respectively; assume that $X$ and $Y$ lie inside the triangle $ABC$. The lines $MN$ and $XY$ intersect at $K$. Prove that $KA=KT$.

Let $J$ be the midpoint of $\seg{AT}$; it is sufficient to show that $\seg{MN}$, $\seg{XY}$, $\seg{OJ}$ are concurrent. Redefine $X$ and $Y$ as the reflections of $X$ and $Y$ across $\seg{OJ}$. We will show that $X$ and $Y$ are the points as described in the problem, which is enough to solve the problem.

But $JM=JN$ by homothety, so $J$ is the circumcenter of $MXYN$. Now $AMXT$ is an isosceles trapezoid, therefore cyclic. To finish, we show that $\seg{OX}\perp\seg{AC}$. But $\seg{OM}$ is perpendicular to $\seg{AM}$, and the reflection of $\seg{AB}$ over $\seg{OJ}$ is parallel to $\seg{AC}$. This is sufficient.
