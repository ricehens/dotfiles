Prove that in a tournament with 799 teams, there exist 14 teams, that can be partitioned into groups in a way that all of the teams in the first group have won all of the teams in the second group.

Let $W(A)$ be the set of teams that $A$ beat. By Jensen's Inequality
\begin{align*}
    \mathbb E\Big[\big\lvert W(A_1)\cap\cdots\cap W(A_7)\big\rvert\Big]&=\frac1{\binom{799}7}\sum_B\binom{W(B)}7\\
    &\ge\frac{799}{\binom{799}7}\binom{\binom{799}2/799}7\\
    &=\frac{799}{\binom{799}7}\binom{399}7\\
    &\approx6.02549>6,
\end{align*}
thus there exist seven teams $A_1$, $\ldots$, $A_7$ such that $\big\lvert W(A_1)\cap\cdots\cap W(A_7)\big\rvert\ge7$, as desired.
