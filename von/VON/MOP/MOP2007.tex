Prove that there are infinitely many pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ such that \[\frac{m+1}n+\frac{n+1}m\]
is an integer.

I will show there are infinitely many $(m,n)$ such that the expression equals $4$. To begin, note that $(1,1)$ works.

Say we have a pair $(m,n)$ for which the expression equals $4$; without loss of generality $m\le n$. Then $m$ is a root of the polynomial \[m^2-(4n-1)m+\left(n^2+n\right)=0.\]
Consequently, the root \[(m',n)=(4n-1-m,n)=\left(\frac{n^2+n}m,n\right)\]
also works. Clearly $m'$ is an integer, and $m'>m$, so we can generate infinitely many $(m,n)$, and we are done.

    For visualization, the process begins \[(1,1)\to(2,1)\to(2,6)\to(21,6)\to(21,77)\to\cdots\]
