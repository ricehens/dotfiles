In the USA, standard letter-size paper is 8.5 inches wide and 11 inches long. What is the largest integer that cannot be written as a sum of a whole number (possibly zero) of 8.5's and a whole number (possibly zero) of 11's?

For the sum to be an integer, we must have an even number of 8.5's. Hence, it is equivalent to consider integers that can be written as a sum of 17's and 11's. From here, by the Chicken McNugget Theorem the answer must be $17\times11-17-11=159$.
