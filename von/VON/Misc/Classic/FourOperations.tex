Find a binary operation $\mathbin\diamondsuit$, such that by composing $\mathbin\diamondsuit$, it is possible to evaluate $a+b$, $a-b$, $a\times b$, and $a\div b$ in finitely many steps for all nonzero real numbers $a$ and $b$. (Fixed constants, such as $-4.5$ and $\pi$, are allowed.)

First we obtain subtraction and inversion. Take $a\mathbin\diamondsuit b=(a-b)^{-1}$. Set $b=0$ to obtain inversion, and invert $a\mathbin\diamondsuit b$ to obtain subtaction.
\begin{remark}
    Taking $a\mathbin\diamondsuit b=\frac1a-b$ also works.
\end{remark}
Now we can negate by taking $0-x$, and thus addition is possible. Halving is also obvious by $\frac1{x/2}=\frac1x+\frac1x$. It suffices to show that multiplication is possible, as consequently division comes from multiplying the inverse. The key is to notice that\[\frac1{x-1}+\frac1{x+1}=\frac2{x^2-1},\]
whence we can square. Finally, $ab=\frac{(a+b)^2-a^2-b^2}2$, and we are done.
