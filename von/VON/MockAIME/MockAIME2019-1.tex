Suppose that $64$ teams, labeled $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_3$, $\ldots$, $T_{64}$, are participating in a tournament. For all $1\le i\le 64$, team $i$ initially has $i$ players. The teams play a series of matches to determine a winner. A match involves two players from different teams, and will result in one player winning and the other losing; no ties occur. When a player loses, he is eliminated, and when all players of a team are eliminated, the team is eliminated. After exactly $2019$ games, $T_k$ is crowned the champion. Find the sum of all possible values of $k$.

First, there are \[1+2+3+\cdots+64=\frac{64\cdot 65}2=2080\]
players in the tournament. For $T_k$ to win, at least $2080-k$ players must have been eliminated. Since each match eliminates exactly one player, \[2019\ge 2080-k\implies k\ge 61.\]
Hence, the requested sum is $61+62+63+64=250$.
