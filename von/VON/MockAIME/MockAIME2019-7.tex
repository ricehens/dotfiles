There are $N$ non-congruent rectangles $\mathcal R$ in the coordinate plane such that all of $\mathcal R$'s vertices have integer coordinates and $\mathcal R$'s area is $32400$. Find $N$.

Let the sides of $\mathcal R$ be $a$ and $b$, so that $ab=32400=2^4\cdot 3^4\cdot 5^2$. Then, $a^2b^2=2^8\cdot 3^8\cdot 5^4$. Since $2=1^2+1^2$, $5=1^2+2^2$, and $10=1^2+3^2$, if $a$ and $b$ have odd exponents of $2$ or $5$, we can orient the rectangle such that the edges have factors of $\sqrt2$, $\sqrt5$, or $\sqrt{10}$. Hence, there are no restrictions on the exponents of $2$ and $5$ in $a$ and $b$.

However, since quadratic residues are $0,1$ modulo $3$, if $\gcd(m,n)=1$, then $m^2+n^2\equiv 1,2\pmod{3}$, so it is impossible to orient a rectangle such that the sides have factors of $\sqrt{3k}$, where $3\nmid k$. Hence, the exponents of $3$ must be even.

Of the $9\cdot 5\cdot 5$ ordered pairs $(a,b)$, one has $a=b$ and the rest have $a\ne b$; hence, to avoid overcount, we halve the cases where $a\ne b$. Hence, the number of such $\mathcal R$ is \[N=\frac{9\cdot 5\cdot 5-1}2+1=113,\]
the answer.

113
