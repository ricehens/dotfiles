Aaron and Erin are working together on a 30-question test that consists of 12 physics problems and 18 math problems. Aaron picks two distinct problems at random so that each problem has an equal chance of being chosen, and correctly solves both of them. Erin then chooses one of the 30 problems to solve so that each problem has an equal chance of being chosen. The probability that the problem Erin chose is an unsolved math problem can be expressed in the form $\tfrac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

By Linearity of Expectation, the expected number of physics problems Aaron solves is $2\cdot 2/5=4/5$ and the expected number of math problems he solves is $2\cdot 3/5=6/5$. Hence, an expected number of $56/5$ physics problems and $84/5$ math problems remain.

Now, the probability Erin chooses an unsolved math problem is simply $84/5\div 30=14/25$, and the requested sum is $14+25=39$.
