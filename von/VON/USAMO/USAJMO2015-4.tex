Find all functions $f:\mathbb Q\to\mathbb Q$ such that \[f(x)+f(t)=f(y)+f(z)\]
for all rational numbers $x<y<z<t$ that form an arithmetic progression.

The answer is $f$ linear. It is easy to check that this works. Now, by the given condition, for all $a,d\in\mathbb Q$,
\begin{align}
f\left(a-\frac32d\right)+f\left(a+\frac32d\right)&=f\left(a-\frac12d\right)+f\left(a+\frac12d\right),\\
f\left(a-\frac32d\right)+f(a)&=f\left(a-\frac12d\right)+f(a-d),\\
f(a)+f\left(a+\frac32d\right)&=f(a+d)+f\left(a+\frac12d\right).
\end{align}
Taking $(2)+(3)-(1)$, \[2f(a)=f(a+d)+f(a-d).\]
This is Jensen's Functional Equation, which is linear.

For completeness, we will prove that Jensen's Functional Equation is linear. Let $g(x)=f(x)-f(0)$. Then, \[2g(a)=g(a+d)+g(a-d)\]
as well, but $g(0)=0$. If $a=d$, we find that $2g(a)=g(2a)$, so \[g(2a)=g(a+d)+g(a-d),\]
which is Cauchy's Functional Equation, done.
